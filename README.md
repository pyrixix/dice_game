# 🎲 Dice Game

A colorful and minimal Python Tkinter GUI app that simulates dice rolls with smooth animation, emoji dice faces, and a running history of the last 5 rolls.

This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates basic GUI development, Unicode character usage, keyboard binding, and simple animation logic, all wrapped in a fun package.
